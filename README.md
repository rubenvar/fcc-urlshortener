# FCC URL Shortener

This app will shorten any URL that you can pass as a parameter. It will return original + shortened urls in a JSON response.

If you visit the shortened url, it will redirect you to the original.

This is the third API project on the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Back End Development Certification.
